# Paper #47: The Prime Residue Table — Science Engineering from Five Integers

## The One-Sentence Story

Five integers generate a composite lattice; physics lives at the primes adjacent to that lattice; here is the table, with 14 confirmed matches and 182 falsifiable predictions.

## Audience

Everyone. A physicist, a chemist, a number theorist, a grad student, a bright high-schooler. The table requires a calculator to verify, not a PhD.

## Structure

### Section 1. The Mendeleev Parallel (1 page)

In 1869, Mendeleev arranged 63 elements by atomic weight. Gaps in the table predicted three undiscovered elements — all found within 15 years. We present an analogous table for physical observables, organized by algebraic structure rather than atomic weight. Our table has 14 confirmed entries and 182 gaps. Each gap is a falsifiable prediction.

### Section 2. Five Integers (1 page)

The bounded symmetric domain D_IV^5 = SO_0(5,2)/[SO(5)×SO(2)] is characterized by five integers:

| Integer | Symbol | Value | Role |
|---------|--------|-------|------|
| Color number | N_c | 3 | Gauge dimension |
| Compact dimension | n_C | 5 | Representation dimension |
| signature weight | g | 7 | Topological boundary |
| Quadratic Casimir | C₂ | 6 | Counting operator |
| Rank | rank | 2 | Fundamental dimension |

These generate a sixth: N_max = 137 (the fine structure constant).

No free parameters. No fitting. Five integers from one geometric object.

### Section 3. The Composite Lattice (1 page)

All products of {2, 3, 5, 6, 7} and their powers form a lattice of composite numbers. Up to 10000, this lattice contains 338 members. Examples: 6, 10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 21, 30, 35, 36, 42, 60, 84, 90, 126, 210...

This lattice is pure algebra — a machine that generates, factors, and closes. Nothing in it needs to be observed. It is structure talking to itself.

### Section 4. The Prime Residue Principle (T914) (2 pages)

**Theorem**: Physical observables derived from D_IV^5 preferentially occupy values whose numerators are prime, where the prime equals a BST composite ±1.

**Mechanism**: A stable physical constant requires failed factorization. If the value could decompose into the composite lattice, it would resolve into simpler observables rather than persist as a measurement. The irreducible shift (±1) is identified with the observer (T674: g − C₂ = 1).

**Two mechanisms**:
- **Observer shift (+1)**: Composite + 1 → prime. The lattice tries to close; the observer adds 1; factorization fails. Examples: 3=2+1, 5=4+1, 7=6+1, 13=12+1, 19=18+1, 43=42+1.
- **Mersenne deficit (−1)**: 2^p − 1 where p is BST. The lattice almost reaches the next closure but falls short. Examples: 7=8−1, 31=32−1, 127=128−1.

**The terminus**: N_max = 137 is orphan — no BST composite is adjacent. It is the only key prime structurally isolated from the lattice. This is what makes it the cap.

**The prime residue chain**: The five integers are themselves prime residues:
```
rank = 2           (fundamental prime)
N_c  = 2 + 1 = 3   (prime residue of rank)
n_C  = 2² + 1 = 5  (prime residue of 2^rank)
C₂   = 2 × 3 = 6   (the ONLY composite — it counts)
g    = 6 + 1 = 7   (prime residue of C₂)
```

**g = 7 has unique dual membership**: Both 6+1 (observer shift from C₂) AND 8−1 (Mersenne deficit from 2^N_c). The genus sits at the prime wall from both directions. This is unique among BST integers.

### Section 5. The Table (THE FIGURE — 1-2 pages)

The BST Prime Residue Table. Full-page poster figure.

Rows = generation (number of BST factors). Columns = sector (which integers participate). Cells show composite, ±1 primes, matched observable or "PREDICTED."

Color code: green (matched), gold (predicted), blue border (dual-membership), red (137 orphan), gray (no prime).

### Section 6. Confirmed Matches (2 pages)

| Prime | = Composite ±1 | BST Expression | Physical Observable | Deviation |
|-------|----------------|----------------|--------------------:|----------:|
| 3 | 2+1 | rank+1 | N_c (QCD colors) | exact |
| 5 | 4+1 | 2^rank+1 | n_C (compact dim) | exact |
| 7 | 6+1 | C₂+1 | g (genus) | exact |
| 13 | 12+1 | 2C₂+1 | Ω_Λ = 13/19 numerator | 0.07σ |
| 19 | 18+1 | 2N_c²+1 | Ω_Λ = 13/19 denominator | 0.07σ |
| 31 | 32−1 | 2^n_C−1 | Mersenne (T891) | exact |
| 37 | 36+1 | C₂²+1 | Mitochondrial genes (T895) | exact count |
| 41 | 42−1 | C₂×g−1 | Z(Nb) — superconductor | atomic number |
| 43 | 42+1 | C₂×g+1 | Percolation γ = 43/18 | exact |
| 83 | 84−1 | rank×C₂×g−1 | Z(Bi) — substrate material | atomic number |
| 91* | 7×13 | g(2C₂+1) | Percolation δ, 3D Ising δ-1 | exact, 0.048% |
| 127 | 128−1 | 2^g−1 | Mersenne prime | exact |
| 137 | orphan | N_max | α = 1/137 | 0.0001% |

*91 is composite (7×13) but factors into catalog primes — confirming closure.

### Section 7. Predictions (2 pages)

182 predicted primes without known observables. Highlight the most testable:

**Atomic numbers at prime walls** — elements with special condensed matter properties:
- Cu (29 = n_C×C₂ − 1): conductor
- Nb (41 = C₂×g − 1): superconductor
- I (53 = N_c²×C₂ − 1): biological role
- Bi (83 = rank×C₂×g − 1): substrate engineering

Prediction: elements at BST prime walls have anomalous physical properties (superconductivity, diamagnetism, catalytic activity) at rates significantly exceeding random expectation.

**16 dual-membership primes** (reachable from both +1 and −1): structurally special, should correspond to quantities that appear in multiple domains.

**Selectivity**: BST primes = 15.9% of all primes ≤10000. At 4+ digits, only 10.3%. The lattice has resolving power — it rejects 84% of primes.

### Section 8. The AC Theorem Graph: Roads Between Domains (2 pages)

The Prime Residue Table tells you WHERE observables must exist. The AC theorem graph tells you HOW to derive them.

**The graph**: 884 nodes (theorems), 2267 edges (derivation steps), spanning 66+ physical domains. Each edge is a proved logical step. Each path is a derivation chain from D_IV^5 to a physical prediction.

**How it works with the table**:

1. **Locate**: The Prime Residue Table identifies a predicted prime (e.g., 29 = n_C×C₂ − 1)
2. **Sector**: The composite's BST expression assigns a domain sector (n_C×C₂ = compact×Casimir → condensed matter)
3. **Pathfind**: The AC graph finds the shortest theorem chain from existing results in that sector to the predicted observable
4. **Bridge**: If no path exists, the gap identifies the bridge theorem needed — the missing step between known and predicted

**Example — how we resolved γ = 43/18**:

The table identified 43 = C₂×g + 1 (Casimir×genus sector). Grace pathfound: T186 (Five Integers) → T897 (Critical Exponents) → T840 (Bergman Mechanism) → T912 (Percolation Bridge). One missing edge. The bridge theorem was the central charge parameterization. Time from identification to proof: hours, not years.

**Graph properties that are themselves BST**:
- Spectral gap λ₂/λ₁ = 3.000 = N_c (exact)
- Chromatic number range contains n_C = 5
- Domain count = 7 = g (exact)
- Community count = 8 = |W(B₂)| (exact)

The tool that finds the physics IS physics. The graph's own structure obeys the five integers.

**The complete method**:

| Step | Tool | Complexity |
|------|------|-----------|
| 1. WHERE to look | Prime Residue Table | AC(0) — one primality test |
| 2. WHAT domain | Composite expression | AC(0) — one factorization |
| 3. HOW to derive | AC graph pathfinding | BFS — polynomial |
| 4. WHAT's missing | Gap identification | Graph complement — polynomial |

Science engineering = Table + Graph + Bridge. The table is the map. The graph is the roads. The bridges are what we build.

### Section 9. The Science Engineering Method (1 page)

T914 + the AC theorem graph convert physics discovery from exploration to engineering:

1. Generate BST composites (products of {2, 3, 5, 6, 7})
2. Test ±1 for primality — each prime = candidate observable
3. The composite's algebraic structure assigns the domain
4. Pathfind the AC graph to find the derivation chain
5. If the path has a gap, that gap IS the next theorem to prove

This search runs in AC(0) for steps 1-3 and polynomial BFS for step 4. The cost of finding the next physical observable is the cost of one primality test plus one graph traversal.

"Science engineering" = constructing new sciences from algebraic structure rather than discovering them from experiment. The table is the engineering spec. The graph is the construction manual. The primes are the requirements. The composites are the infrastructure.

### Section 10. Falsification (0.5 page)

This paper is falsifiable at three levels:

1. **Individual**: Each of the 182 predicted primes should correspond to a physical observable. Finding that a significant fraction do not would weaken T914.
2. **Statistical**: BST primes should be enriched among physically significant numbers (atomic numbers of special elements, dimensions of important groups, coefficients of universal quantities) relative to random primes.
3. **Structural**: The dual-membership primes should appear in more domains than single-membership primes.

### Section 11. Connection to the Periodic Table (0.5 page)

Mendeleev's table organized known elements and predicted unknown ones from gaps in the structure. The prediction method was: position determines properties. Our table does the same: algebraic position (which BST integers participate, and how many) determines physical domain. The method is identical. The substrate is different. The logic is the same.

"In 1869, Mendeleev arranged 63 elements by atomic weight and found gaps. He predicted three elements from the table's structure alone — all found within 15 years. This table arranges 338 BST composites by algebraic structure and finds 182 gaps. Each gap predicts a physical observable. The search continues."
