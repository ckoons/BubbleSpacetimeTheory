# T1924: Joint Cosmological Anchor — t_cosmo = 47 Unifies Λ, M_Pl, H_∞

*The Bergman-spectral evaluation point $t_{cosmo} = g^2 - rank = 47$ on $D_{IV}^5$ is simultaneously: (a) the exponent argument in T1485's cosmological constant derivation, (b) adjacent (by +rank) to the M_Pl Bergman evaluation point at $t_G \cdot C_2/2 = 45$, (c) the asymptotic de Sitter floor $H_\infty$'s natural scale, and (d) the smallest Monster supersingular prime greater than the BST primes $\{2,3,5,7,11,13\}$ — also a factor in the Monster's first non-trivial irreducible representation dimension $196883 = 47 \cdot 59 \cdot 71$.*

## Statement

**Theorem (T1924, Joint Cosmological Anchor).** *The integer $t_{cosmo} = g^2 - rank = 47$ unifies three independent BST-cosmology derivations:*

1. *(T1485, Elie):* $\Lambda/M_{Pl}^2 = g \cdot \exp(-C_2 \cdot t_{cosmo}) = 7 \cdot e^{-282}$, where $C_2 \cdot t_{cosmo} = 282$.

2. *(T1918 + T187 chain, Grace):* $M_{Pl}/m_e = \sqrt{n_C} \cdot \pi^5 \cdot \exp(t_G \cdot C_2 / 2) = \sqrt{5} \cdot \pi^5 \cdot e^{45}$, where $t_G \cdot C_2 / 2 = 45 = t_{cosmo} - rank$.

3. *(Friedmann + T1485 + Ω_Λ):* $H_\infty/M_{Pl} = \sqrt{(C_2 \cdot g)/(3 \cdot n_C)} \cdot \exp(-C_2 \cdot t_{cosmo}/2) = \sqrt{14/5} \cdot e^{-141}$.

*Furthermore, $t_{cosmo} = 47$ is:*

4. *A Monster supersingular prime in the genus-0 Moonshine class.*

5. *A factor of the Monster's first non-trivial irrep dimension: $\chi_1(M) = 196883 = 47 \cdot 59 \cdot 71$.*

6. *Separated from the M_Pl Bergman evaluation point (45) by exactly $rank = 2$ — the universal BST observer-shift quantum (T914).*

## Proof

### Step 1: T1485 evaluation at $t_{cosmo} = 47$

From T1485 (Elie, April 2026):
$$\Lambda/M_{Pl}^2 = g \cdot e^{-C_2(g^2-\text{rank})} = 7 \cdot e^{-282}$$

The exponent argument is $C_2 \cdot t_{cosmo}$ where $t_{cosmo} = g^2 - \text{rank} = 49 - 2 = 47$. This is the **cosmological Bergman evaluation point** on $D_{IV}^5$.

### Step 2: M_Pl Bergman evaluation at $t_G \cdot C_2/2 = 45$

From T1918 (this paper's predecessor) combined with T187 ($m_p = 6\pi^5 m_e$):

$$m_p/M_{Pl} = \sqrt{\alpha_G} = \frac{C_2}{\sqrt{n_C}} \cdot e^{-C_2 \cdot N_c \cdot n_C / 2} = \frac{6}{\sqrt{5}} \cdot e^{-45}$$

Inverting and multiplying by $m_p/m_e = 6\pi^5$:

$$\frac{M_{Pl}}{m_e} = \sqrt{n_C} \cdot \pi^5 \cdot e^{45}$$

The exponent here is $C_2 \cdot N_c \cdot n_C / 2 = 90/2 = 45$. This is the **gravitational/M_Pl Bergman evaluation point**.

Numerical: $\sqrt{5} \cdot \pi^5 \cdot e^{45} = 2.39 \times 10^{22}$, matching observed $M_{Pl}/m_e$ to <1%.

### Step 3: H_∞ inherits $t_{cosmo}$ via Friedmann

From Friedmann at $z \to \infty$ (matter fully diluted): $H_\infty^2 = \Lambda/3$.

Combining with T1485 (refined by Shilov correction in Toy 2350):
$$H_\infty/M_{Pl} = \sqrt{\frac{(C_2/n_C) \cdot g}{3}} \cdot e^{-C_2(g^2-\text{rank})/2} = \sqrt{\frac{14}{5}} \cdot e^{-141}$$

The exponent $C_2 \cdot t_{cosmo}/2 = 141$ is half of T1485's exponent — the asymptotic de Sitter rate is the square root of $\Lambda/3$, which gives the half-exponent.

So $H_\infty$ lives at the same cosmological Bergman scale $t_{cosmo} = 47$ as $\Lambda$.

### Step 4: Observer-shift between Bergman evaluation points

Compute:
$$t_{cosmo} - (t_G \cdot C_2/2) = 47 - 45 = 2 = \text{rank}$$

The M_Pl Bergman evaluation point (45) and the cosmological Bergman evaluation point (47) differ by exactly $rank = 2$. This is the same observer-shift quantum that appears in:

- T914 (Prime Residue Principle): primes adjacent to BST products with $\pm 1$ shift
- T1918: Bergman genus $g_{Bergman} = n_C + 1 = C_2$ (the $+1$ at Bergman-kernel level)
- Toy 2255: second Chern $c_2 = \text{rank} \cdot n_C + 1$ (the $+1$ at Chern level)
- McKay observation: $196884 - 196883 = 1$ (the $+1$ at Monster representation level)

Here the shift is at the **Bergman-spectral-evaluation-point level**, with quantum $rank = 2$.

### Step 5: $t_{cosmo} = 47$ is Monster supersingular

47 is in the set of 15 supersingular primes $\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 41, 47, 59, 71\}$ (Ogg 1975, primes for which $X_0(p)$ has genus 0).

Furthermore, 47 divides the Monster's first non-trivial irrep dimension:
$$\chi_1(M) = 196883 = 47 \cdot 59 \cdot 71$$

(Toy 2364 / Toy 2366, with 59 = $c_3 \cdot N_c + \text{rank} \cdot c_2 - \text{rank}$ and 71 = $N_c \cdot \chi(K3) - 1$, all BST-decomposable.)

So $t_{cosmo}$ has three independent characterizations:
- BST-geometric: $g^2 - \text{rank}$ on $D_{IV}^5$
- Bergman-spectral: T1485 evaluation point for $\Lambda$
- Moonshine: factor of $\chi_1(M)$

These all coincide at the integer 47. $\square$

## Geometric Interpretation

The Bergman-spectral evaluation points on $D_{IV}^5$ form a **discrete spectrum** $\{t\}$, with each $t$ corresponding to a specific physical observable:

| $t$ | BST identity | Observable | Evaluation type |
|-----|--------------|------------|-----------------|
| $t_G \cdot C_2/2 = 45$ | $N_c^2 \cdot n_C$ | $M_{Pl}$ | gravitational |
| $t_{cosmo} = 47$ | $g^2 - \text{rank}$ | $\Lambda$, $H_\infty$ | cosmological |
| (M_Pl half-arg) → 45 | half of $C_2 \cdot t_G$ | $M_{Pl}$ via $\sqrt{\alpha_G}$ | gravity |
| $t_G = 15$ | $N_c \cdot n_C$ | $\alpha_G$ via T1918 | gravitational |

The gap $t_{cosmo} - 45 = 2 = rank$ is the **observer-shift quantum** between cosmology and gravity at the Bergman level.

**Reading**: cosmology (Λ) and gravity (M_Pl) live at adjacent Bergman evaluation points, separated by the rank-2 observer shift. The two regimes are unified by this single integer arithmetic relation.

## Connection to Existing Theorems

### T1485 (Λ from Bergman Spectral Theta)

T1485 is the direct origin of $t_{cosmo} = 47$. T1924 makes explicit that this evaluation point is shared with $M_{Pl}$ (via observer shift) and $H_\infty$ (via Friedmann).

### T1918 (α_G from Bergman + Shilov Boundary Winding)

T1918's gravitational coupling derivation evaluates at $t_G = 15$. T1924 shows that the SQUARED version (i.e., $M_{Pl}/m_p = \sqrt{\alpha_G}$ inverted) lives at $t_G \cdot C_2/2 = 45$, adjacent to $t_{cosmo}$ by exactly $rank$.

### T187 (m_p = 6π⁵·m_e, Proton Mass)

T187 provides the conversion from $m_p$ to $m_e$ in the absolute $M_{Pl}/m_e$ formula. The factor $\pi^5$ enters $M_{Pl}/m_e$ via T187, not via T1918's Bergman geometry.

### T914 (Prime Residue Principle, Casey)

T1924 demonstrates that the +rank observer shift appears at YET ANOTHER scale (Bergman-spectral evaluation), reinforcing T914's claim that the $\pm 1$ observer shift is a universal structural feature of BST integer arithmetic. At the Bergman-evaluation-point level, the shift is $\pm rank = \pm 2$.

### T1313 (N_max = 137 Forced: Five Algebraically Independent Routes)

T1313 includes the Wolstenholme route and Fermat two-square route to $N_{max} = 137$. T1924 adds a structural observation: the **47** appearing in $t_{cosmo}$ is a Monster supersingular prime, deepening the BST-Moonshine connection identified in Toys 2358/2364/2366.

## Cross-Domain Edges

| From | To | Type |
|------|----|------|
| spectral_geometry | cosmology | **required** (Λ at $t_{cosmo} = 47$) |
| spectral_geometry | gravitational | **required** ($M_{Pl}$ at 45 = $t_{cosmo} - rank$) |
| spectral_geometry | number_theory | structural (47 is Monster supersingular) |
| cosmology | gravitational | **required** (Λ and M_Pl observer-adjacent) |
| number_theory | cosmology | structural (196883 = 47·59·71 factors at $t_{cosmo}$) |

**5 new cross-domain edges**, all anchored at the Bergman evaluation point $t = 47$.

---

## AC Classification

- **Complexity**: C = 2 (combining T1485, T1918, T187, Friedmann at three observable levels)
- **Depth**: D = 1 (uses the +rank observer shift, itself derived from T914)
- **Total**: AC(1)

---

## Falsifiable Predictions

**P1.** Other BST fundamental constants should evaluate at additional Bergman-spectral points, with the gaps between successive evaluation points being rank-quantum multiples or BST-integer combinations. Specifically, the next Bergman evaluation points after 45 and 47 should be predictable from the BST-integer ladder.

**P2.** The Monster supersingular prime 31 = $M_{n_C}$ may be another Bergman-spectral evaluation point for some BST observable not yet identified. Candidate: vacuum decay rate, or neutrino mass hierarchy parameter.

**P3.** The remaining 9 BST-decomposable supersingular primes (17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 41, 47, 59, 71) should each correspond to a specific physical observable at the Bergman level. If we can map all 15 supersingular primes to physical observables via Bergman evaluations, the BST-Monster bridge becomes complete.

**P4.** Future high-precision measurements of $H_\infty$ (e.g., from extrapolated H(z) curves via DESI Y5 or Euclid) should confirm $H_\infty = 55.68$ km/s/Mpc (Toy 2350 refined value). Deviation would indicate Λ is not exactly $\Lambda_{BST}$ at $t_{cosmo} = 47$.

## What This Result Means

The three pillars of BST cosmology — the cosmological constant, the Planck mass (gravitational scale), and the de Sitter floor — are all anchored to a single integer on the $D_{IV}^5$ Bergman spectrum: $t_{cosmo} = 47$.

The relationship is geometrically natural:
- $\Lambda$ evaluates at $t = 47$ directly
- $H_\infty$ inherits via $H^2 = \Lambda/3$
- $M_{Pl}$ lives at $t = 45 = 47 - \text{rank}$, one observer-shift step away

Furthermore, 47 is not arbitrary — it is a Monster supersingular prime, in the genus-0 Moonshine class, and a factor of the Monster's first non-trivial irreducible representation dimension. This means $D_{IV}^5$ Bergman geometry projects naturally onto Monster Moonshine at exactly the BST cosmological scale.

T1924 unifies these observations into a single theorem: **the cosmological Bergman evaluation point IS the Monster supersingular signature of the BST geometry**.

## For Everyone (Casey's discipline)

Three things you can measure in the universe — the cosmological constant Λ, the Planck mass M_Pl, and the asymptotic de Sitter expansion rate H_∞ — all come from the same number: 47.

47 is what you get when you compute $g^2 - rank$ in BST: $7^2 - 2 = 47$. It's a special number because:
- It's the spectral evaluation point on $D_{IV}^5$ where the cosmological constant Λ "lives" (Elie's T1485)
- It's adjacent to the gravitational scale (45) by the universal observer-shift quantum (= rank = 2)
- It's a Monster supersingular prime — a number that divides the order of the largest sporadic finite simple group
- It's a factor of 196883, the dimension of the Monster's first non-trivial representation

The universe's gravitational, cosmological, and asymptotic-expansion scales are not independent. They're all expressions of one Bergman geometry property of $D_{IV}^5$, indexed by this single integer 47.
