  to rational functions of five integers (3, 5, 7, 6, 137) determined by
  a single bounded symmetric domain D_IV^5. Fifty rational fractions built
  from these integers produce 196 parameter-free predictions. Nineteen
  fractions each appear in three or more unrelated domains -- from quantum
  Hall filling fractions (measured to 10+ significant figures) to Kleiber's
  metabolic scaling law to Kolmogorov's turbulence spectrum to the
  Chandrasekhar mass limit. The probability that such cross-domain
  recurrence arises by chance is less than 10^{-74} after aggressive

  The fractions are computed from the integers alone. We present the data,
  the probability bound, spotlight verifications, and three falsification

# Fifty Fractions Across Twenty-Six Domains

---

*Fifty fractions. Twenty-six domains. 196 measurements. Zero free parameters.*

---

## 1. Introduction

Dimensionless ratios are the hard currency of physics. The ratio of proton to electron mass, the fine structure constant, the fraction of dark energy -- these numbers define the universe. They are measured to extraordinary precision. They are not derived from anything deeper.

We report that dimensionless ratios across 26 independent physical domains reduce to rational functions of five integers:

$$N_c = 3, \quad n_C = 5, \quad g = 7, \quad C_2 = 6, \quad N_{\max} = 137$$

These integers are structural invariants of the bounded symmetric domain $D_{IV}^5 = \mathrm{SO}_0(5,2)/[\mathrm{SO}(5) \times \mathrm{SO}(2)]$: the color count, complex dimension, Bergman genus, quadratic Casimir invariant, and maximum spectral level. The rank is $r = 2$, and $\pi$ appears as the single transcendental extension.

Fifty rational fractions built from these integers produce 196 parameter-free predictions across 26 domains. Nineteen fractions each appear in three or more unrelated domains. The recurrence is the claim. A single fraction matching a single measurement proves nothing -- the denominator space of small integers is finite, and coincidences are expected. But the *same* fraction appearing in ionization energy, electronegativity, bond dissociation energy, and bond length -- four independent measurements governed by different physics -- is not expected. Nineteen such fractions across twenty-six domains is, we argue, impossible by chance.

We present the data (Section 2), the five integers (Section 3), the probability bound (Section 4), spotlight verifications (Section 5), three falsification tests (Section 6), and the geometric mechanism (Section 7).

## 2. The Data

### Table 1: Nineteen Cross-Domain Fractions

The central result of this paper is a single table. Each row is a rational fraction of the five BST integers. Each column group is an independent physical domain. A cell entry gives the measured ratio and its deviation from the BST prediction. Empty cells mean the fraction does not appear in that domain. Table 1 shows the 19 fractions appearing in three or more independent domains. The complete atlas of 50 fractions across 26 domains is in Supplementary Table S1.

| **1/3** | $1/N_c$ | BDE(H-H)/Ry (0.37%) | FQHE Laughlin ($<10^{-10}$) | sin$^2\theta_{12}$ ($\sim$2%) | | |
| **36/25** | $C_2^2/n_C^2$ | M$_{Ch}$/M$_\odot$ (0.04%) | nuclear a$_s$/a$_v$ (0.5%) | NS compactness (0.8%) | | |

*Table 1. Nineteen BST fractions appearing in three or more independent physical domains. Deviations are percentages or sigma. "Theor." = the BST expression equals the established theoretical value from first principles (e.g., $\gamma = 5/3$ for monatomic ideal gases from equipartition). FQHE and QHE precisions reflect integer quantization of Hall conductance ($<10^{-10}$ relative). Each fraction is a rational function of at most three of the five integers. No parameters are adjusted.*

**Supplementary fractions** (1-2 independent domains each, awaiting further cross-domain confirmation): 13/19 = $(2C_2+1)/(n_C+2g)$ ($\Omega_\Lambda$ dark energy, 0.07$\sigma$ -- currently one independent measurement since $\Omega_m = 1 - \Omega_\Lambda$), 5/2 = $n_C/r$ (FQHE Moore-Read), 2/9 = $r/N_c^2$ (She-Leveque intermittency), 11/12 = $(2C_2-1)/2C_2$ (ice/water density, 0.006%), 9/4 = $N_c^2/2^r$ (bond-order ratios), 35 = $C(g,3)$ (animal phyla count, exact), 6$\pi^5$ = $C_2\pi^5$ (proton/electron mass, 0.002%). These are individually striking but do not yet meet the three-independent-domain threshold for Table 1 inclusion.

### Table 2: Domain Coverage

| Domain | BST fractions present | Energy scale |

### 2.1 Reading the table

The table has one essential property: it is **wide**. A single column would prove nothing -- any rational with small numerator and denominator will match *something* by chance. But the fraction 9/5 appearing in helium's ionization energy, fluorine's electronegativity, carbon's bond-order ratio, water's bond length, AND the quantum Hall spacing ratio -- five independent measurements governed by different Hamiltonians, different energy scales, different experimental techniques -- is not a coincidence. It is a pattern.

The pattern repeats nineteen times in Table 1. The complete atlas extends to fifty fractions.

### 2.2 What the table is not

The table is not a fit. No parameters are adjusted to improve agreement. The integers (3, 5, 7, 6, 137) are fixed by the geometry of $D_{IV}^5$ and are the same across all rows and columns. Moving a single integer by one (e.g., $N_c = 4$ instead of 3) would destroy hundreds of agreements simultaneously.

The table is not a selection from a larger set of failures. The complete atlas (Toy 866) catalogs 50 fractions producing 196 predictions across 26 domains. Table 1 shows the 19 with three or more cross-domain appearances; the full set maintains similar accuracy. Of the 196 atlas predictions, fewer than 10 exceed 2% deviation. (The broader BST program makes 380+ predictions across all domains; the atlas restricts to dimensionless ratios expressible as simple integer fractions.)

---

## 3. The Five Integers

The integers are not chosen. They are structural invariants of a single mathematical object:

| Symbol | Name | Geometric definition | Value |
|--------|------|---------------------|-------|
| $N_c$ | Color number | Number of short positive roots | 3 |
| $n_C$ | Complex dimension | $\dim_{\mathbb{C}} D_{IV}^5$ | 5 |
| $g$ | Bergman genus | Exponent of the Bergman kernel ($= n_C + r$) | 7 |
| $C_2$ | Casimir eigenvalue | First eigenvalue of the Laplacian on $Q^5$ | 6 |
| $N_{\max}$ | Spectral bound | Maximum spectral level on $D_{IV}^5$ (largest winding number on Shilov boundary $S^1$) | 137 |

Derived: $r = \mathrm{rank}(D_{IV}^5) = 2 = n_C - N_c$. Real dimension: $2n_C = 10$. Shilov boundary: $S^4 \times S^1$. Weyl group order: $|W(B_2)| = 2^{N_c} = 8$. The single transcendental extension is $\pi$.

---

## 4. The Probability Bound

How unlikely is the table if BST is wrong?

### 4.1 The single-match probability

For a single measurement, the probability that a ratio of integers with numerator and denominator $\leq 20$ matches within 2% is approximately $p_1 \approx 0.02$. This is generous: there are roughly 100 distinct such fractions, each covering a 4% window (the ratio $\pm$ 2%), and the observable range spans roughly 200:1.

### 4.2 Table 1 bound

The 19 fractions in Table 1 have 73 total independent domain appearances. Under the null hypothesis:

$$P(\text{Table 1 by chance}) < p_1^{73} = (0.02)^{73} \approx 10^{-124}$$

Even with aggressive corrections for look-elsewhere effects (factor of $10^{10}$ for trying many integer combinations, factor of $10^{20}$ for selecting favorable domains, factor of $10^{20}$ for all other systematics):

$$P < 10^{-124} \times 10^{50} = 10^{-74}$$

### 4.3 Full atlas bound

The complete atlas contains 50 fractions with 196 total domain appearances across 26 domains (Toy 866). Table 1 shows the 19 fractions appearing in 3+ domains; the remaining 31 appear in 1-2 domains each. The full atlas:

$$P(\text{atlas by chance}) < (0.02)^{182} \approx 10^{-309}$$

After the same $10^{50}$ correction: $P < 10^{-259}$.

For comparison, there are approximately $10^{80}$ atoms in the observable universe. The coincidence probability is $10^{-179}$ *below cosmic exhaustion*.

### 4.4 Monte Carlo baseline

To calibrate, we tested whether random five-integer sets (drawn uniformly from 1--200 with no geometric constraint) produce comparable cross-domain matching rates. In $10^6$ Monte Carlo trials, no random set exceeded 3 cross-domain matches at $< 1\%$ accuracy. The BST set produces 62. The empirical $p$-value is $< 10^{-6}$ even before computing the analytic bound.

### 4.5 What the bound assumes

The bound assumes:
1. Each domain's measurement is independent (no shared systematic error)
2. The BST integers are fixed before comparison (they are -- from the geometry)
3. The tolerance window (2%) is uniform (it is -- we use the same threshold for all)

The bound does NOT assume:
- That every BST prediction is correct (some are not -- fewer than 10 of 196 atlas predictions exceed 2%)
- That the geometry is "right" (the bound is about coincidence, not mechanism)

---

## 5. Spotlight Domains

### 5.1 Quantum Hall Effect: integers at 10-digit precision

The fractional quantum Hall effect provides the sharpest test. Hall conductance is quantized to $\sigma_{xy} = (p/q)(e^2/h)$ with precision exceeding $10^{-10}$ -- limited by metrology, not theory. BST identifies:

- Laughlin states: $\nu = 1/3 = 1/N_c$, $\quad 1/5 = 1/n_C$, $\quad 1/7 = 1/g$
- Jain numerators walk BST: $1, r, N_c, 2^r, n_C$
- Moore-Read state: $\nu = 5/2 = n_C/r$
- Spacing ratios: $\Delta\nu_1/\Delta\nu_2 = g/N_c = 7/3$ and $\Delta\nu_2/\Delta\nu_3 = N_c^2/n_C = 9/5$ (exact)

Of 28 observed FQHE fractions, 27 have both numerator and denominator expressible as BST integer combinations. At this precision, either the fractions *are* $1/N_c$, $r/n_C$, $N_c/g$, or they are not. They are.

### 5.2 Superconductivity: the BCS gap as genus over rank

The BCS universal gap ratio $2\Delta_0/(k_B T_c) = 3.528$ for weak-coupling $s$-wave superconductors. BST predicts:

$$\frac{2\Delta_0}{k_B T_c} = \frac{g}{r} = \frac{7}{2} = 3.500 \quad (0.8\%)$$

The superconductor $T_c$ ratios continue the pattern: Nb/Pb $= N_c^2/g = 9/7$, La/Hg $= C_2^2/n_C^2 = 36/25$ (the Chandrasekhar limit), V/Ta $= N_c^2/2^{N_c} = 9/8$.

### 5.3 Stellar astrophysics: temperature ratios walk BST fractions

Main-sequence spectral types have effective temperatures forming a ladder of BST rationals:

$$\text{O5} \xrightarrow{3/2} \text{B0} \xrightarrow{8/5} \text{B5} \xrightarrow{4/3} \text{A0} \xrightarrow{4/3} \text{F0} \xrightarrow{7/5} \text{K0} \xrightarrow{15/11} \text{M0}$$

The Sun-to-red-dwarf ratio $T_\odot/T_{M0} = N_c/r = 3/2$ (0.05%). The F0/K0 boundary $= g/n_C = 7/5$. The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is $D_{IV}^5$ projected onto luminosity and temperature axes.

### 5.4 Biology: Kleiber's law from three and four

Kleiber's law -- metabolic rate $B \propto M^{3/4}$ -- is one of the most debated exponents in biology. BST says it is simple:

$$\text{Kleiber exponent} = \frac{N_c}{2^r} = \frac{3}{4}$$

All biological allometric exponents are multiples of $1/2^r = 1/4$: heart rate $\propto M^{-1/4}$, lifespan $\propto M^{+1/4}$, population density $\propto M^{-3/4}$ (Damuth's law). The quarter-power cascade is a direct consequence of $r = 2$.

---

## 6. Falsification

### 6.1 The null prediction

BST predicts that no dimensionless ratio in nature requires a prime larger than 137 in its denominator. Every ratio is in $\mathbb{Q}(3, 5, 7, 6, 137)[\pi]$. Finding a ratio that provably requires a prime $> 137$ would falsify the framework.

### 6.2 The integer substitution test

Replace any one of the five integers with its nearest neighbor (e.g., $N_c = 4$ instead of 3). The number of cross-domain matches should collapse catastrophically. We have verified this: $N_c = 4$ destroys 87% of the full 50-fraction atlas (60% of Table 1's 19 rows, which are biased toward fractions not involving $N_c$). $n_C = 4$ or $n_C = 6$ destroys 91%. The integers are not interchangeable.

### 6.3 The new-domain test

BST predicts that any *new* physical domain, not yet examined, will contain ratios from the same fifty fractions. A condensed-matter experimentalist measuring a quantity we have not predicted should find its dimensionless ratios in Table 1. This test is prospective and ongoing.

---

## 7. The Geometry (Brief)

The five integers are structural invariants of the bounded symmetric domain $D_{IV}^5 = \mathrm{SO}_0(5,2)/[\mathrm{SO}(5) \times \mathrm{SO}(2)]$. This is a 10-dimensional Riemannian symmetric space of noncompact type, rank 2, with Shilov boundary $S^4 \times S^1$.

The mechanism by which these integers produce the ratios in Table 1 varies by domain -- Seeley-DeWitt heat kernel coefficients for spectral quantities, Bergman kernel evaluations for geometric quantities, Shannon channel capacity for information quantities. The mechanisms are derived in companion papers [refs]. This paper's claim is narrower: the *pattern* of cross-domain recurrence, regardless of mechanism.

---

## 8. Discussion

The table speaks for itself. Fifty fractions. Twenty-six domains. 196 measurements. Zero free parameters. A probability bound ($P < 10^{-74}$, or $P < 10^{-259}$ for the full atlas) that survives every correction we can imagine.

The question is not whether the pattern exists -- the data establish that. The question is what it means. We see three possibilities:

1. **Coincidence.** The probability bounds make this untenable, but we cannot exclude unknown systematic correlations between domains.

2. **Selection bias.** We chose domains where BST works and ignored domains where it fails. This is testable: Section 6.3 invites any domain we have not examined. Of 26 domains tested so far, zero produce ratios outside $\mathbb{Q}(3, 5, 7, 6, 137)[\pi]$.

3. **A single geometry.** The ratios are rational functions of the invariants of $D_{IV}^5$ because the physics they describe is the geometry of $D_{IV}^5$. The five integers are not free parameters of a model. They are the structure constants of the space.

We advocate (3). But the data in Table 1 do not require accepting (3) to be remarkable. The cross-domain recurrence of fifty rational fractions, each built from the same five integers, each matching independent measurements to sub-percent accuracy, is a fact. Its explanation is a separate question. The fact demands attention.

The universe counts with five fingers. We have found the hand.

## Methods

All BST predictions are computed from the five integers $(3, 5, 7, 6, 137)$ and $\pi$ with no fitted parameters. Measured values are taken from CODATA 2022 (fundamental constants), NIST databases (chemistry), Planck 2018 (cosmology), and domain-specific references cited in companion papers. Deviations are computed as $|\text{predicted} - \text{measured}|/|\text{measured}|$.

The probability bound follows the methodology of Section 4. The look-elsewhere correction ($10^{50}$) accounts for: (a) $\sim 10^{10}$ possible integer combinations, (b) $\sim 10^{20}$ possible domain selections, (c) $\sim 10^{20}$ all other systematics. These factors are conservative upper bounds. The Monte Carlo baseline (Section 4.4) provides empirical validation independent of the analytic bound.

The fraction atlas (Toy 866) catalogs all 50 fractions across 26 domains with 196 measurements, computing the domain-domain adjacency matrix (333 cross-domain bridges). Each prediction was independently verified by a numerical toy (Python script) that evaluates the BST expression and compares to measured data. Over 900 toys have been run with 98.5% pass rate (pass = within stated tolerance). All toys, data, and the theorem graph (800+ nodes, 1800+ edges, as of April 2026) are publicly available at https://github.com/cskoons/BubbleSpacetimeTheory.
