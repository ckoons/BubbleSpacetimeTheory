# Dictionary L2 — Region (Shilov/Bulk) + Gell-Mann–Nishijima

## 0. Where this sits

The keystone (#408) identified the Hall algebra's B₂ with the SO(5) of K=SO(5)×SO(2) and converted σ_BF + Charge(SO(2)-handle) to derived. L2 closes the **Region** axis (the bulk-vs-Shilov distinction Casey made central) and **locates** the electroweak charge structure (GMN). Region is geometric — Casey's preferred route — and it comes out clean.

## 1. The Region result (RIGOROUS structure): the Shilov stabilizer is electroweak

**The Shilov boundary of D_IV⁵** is S = (S⁴ × S¹)/Z₂ (the Lie sphere), real dimension (n−1)+1 = 5 = n_C. The maximal compact K = SO(5)×SO(2) acts transitively on S, and the **point-stabilizer** is

  M = SO(4) = SU(2)_L × SU(2)_R    (dim check: dim K − dim M = 11 − 6 = 5 = dim S ✓).

So the **internal symmetry available on the Shilov boundary is SO(4) = SU(2)_L × SU(2)_R** — exactly the weak-isospin group of the electroweak sector. The bulk (interior of D_IV⁵), by contrast, carries the full K = SO(5)×SO(2).

This single fact does a lot:

| | Shilov boundary | Bulk (interior) |
|---|---|---|
| internal symmetry | SO(4) = SU(2)_L × SU(2)_R | full SO(5) × SO(2) |
| function space | Hardy H²(S) | Bergman (holomorphic L²) |
| ρ-vector marker | ρ₂ = N_c/rank = 3/2 (Wallach point) | ρ₁ = n_C/rank = 5/2 (Bergman genus) |
| color | NONE (SO(4) has no color structure) | carried by the full SO(5) |
| particles | **leptons** (light, fundamental, colorless SU(2) doublets) | **quarks / composites** (colored, heavy, 3D constructions) |

### 1.1 What this derives (two things from one fact)

- **Lepton-on-Shilov** (Casey's directive): leptons live on the Shilov boundary because the boundary's symmetry SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R is exactly the lepton (electroweak, colorless) content — leptons ARE the boundary K-types.
- **Lepton colorlessness**: leptons have no color because the Shilov stabilizer SO(4) carries no color structure — color requires the full SO(5), which is only available in the bulk. Quarks therefore must be bulk objects (colored, composite/heavy — the "3D constructions from a different region" Casey described).

So the bulk/Shilov split is not a labeling — it is the geometric distinction between the Hardy space (boundary, SO(4), colorless leptons) and the Bergman space (bulk, full SO(5), colored quarks), separated by the ρ-vector (3/2 vs 5/2). **Region axis: DERIVED (geometric).**

## 2. Gell-Mann–Nishijima — LOCATED (structure rigorous, coefficients pinned-not-asserted)

With weak isospin living in the Shilov stabilizer SU(2)_L × SU(2)_R:
- **T₃** (third component of weak isospin) = the Cartan of **SU(2)_L** ⊂ SO(4) ⊂ SO(5).
- **Hypercharge Y** = a combination of the **SU(2)_R** Cartan (T₃_R) and the **SO(2)** charge b — the left-right-symmetric form Y/2 = T₃_R + (B−L)/2, with the SO(2) supplying the (B−L)/baryon-lepton direction.
- **Gell-Mann–Nishijima**: Q = T₃ + Y/2 = T₃_L + T₃_R + (SO(2) piece).

So GMN's ingredients all sit in identified Cartan directions of K = SO(5)×SO(2): T₃ in SU(2)_L, the rest in SU(2)_R + SO(2). The STRUCTURE is rigorous (these subgroups are there, with these roles). The **exact embedding coefficients** (the precise linear combination giving Y, the normalization of the SO(2) charge) are a genuine choice that I will PIN, not assert — consistent with the standing discipline (the genus flipped three times from memory-relabeling; I will not relabel the electroweak embedding from memory). Routed: the SU(2)_L×U(1)_Y ↪ SO(5)×SO(2) embedding coefficients (cross-check against the derived sin²θ_W = rank/N_c² = 2/9 — the embedding must reproduce the Weinberg angle).

### 2.1 Consistency check available now

The derived **sin²θ_W = rank/N_c² = 2/9** (Weinberg mechanism, T-series) is a constraint on the SU(2)_L–U(1)_Y embedding. Whatever the exact coefficients, they must reproduce 2/9. This is the pin's acceptance test: the embedding is correct iff it yields sin²θ_W = 2/9. (So GMN is not free — it's constrained by an already-derived quantity.)

## 3. The 5-tuple after L2

| 5-tuple axis | status after L2 |
|---|---|
| σ_BF | DERIVED (keystone — SO(5)-weight parity) |
| Charge | LOCATED — SO(2) + GMN structure (T₃∈SU(2)_L, Y from SU(2)_R+SO(2)); exact coeffs pinned-not-asserted, constrained by sin²θ_W=2/9 |
| **Region** | **DERIVED (geometric)** — Hardy(Shilov, SO(4), colorless) vs Bergman(bulk, SO(5), color); lepton-on-Shilov + colorlessness from one fact |
| Chirality | STAGED — SU(2)_L vs SU(2)_R asymmetry on the Shilov boundary is the handle (parity violation = the boundary picks SU(2)_L); L3 |
| Winding/generation | STAGED — δ-tower; mechanism leans Coxeter/δ; count open |
| particle/antiparticle | DERIVED (engine v0.4 — E/F) |

**Bonus (chirality handle sharpened)**: chirality/parity-violation now has a concrete home — the Shilov boundary distinguishes SU(2)_L from SU(2)_R (the boundary dynamics can couple to one chirality). That's the L3 lever: parity violation is the boundary breaking the L↔R symmetry of SO(4). (Stated as the handle, not yet derived.)

## 4. Honest scope + tier

**RIGOROUS (geometry/rep theory)**: Shilov boundary of D_IV⁵ = (S⁴×S¹)/Z₂, dim 5; K=SO(5)×SO(2) transitive; stabilizer M=SO(4)=SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R (dim check exact); Hardy vs Bergman; ρ-vector markers (3/2 Shilov, 5/2 bulk).

**DERIVED (this doc, modulo the keystone bet)**: Region = Hardy(Shilov) vs Bergman(bulk); lepton-on-Shilov; lepton colorlessness. These follow from the stabilizer being SO(4) (colorless electroweak) — a rigorous geometric fact, given the keystone identification (K-types = particles).

**LOCATED, NOT YET DERIVED**: GMN exact coefficients (SU(2)_L×U(1)_Y ↪ SO(5)×SO(2)) — structure rigorous, coefficients pinned-not-asserted, constrained by sin²θ_W=2/9.

**STAGED**: Chirality (handle = SU(2)_L vs SU(2)_R boundary asymmetry = parity violation, L3); Winding (δ-tower).

**Cal #27 / honesty**: the Region result is genuinely clean and I'm leaning into it (it derives TWO physics facts — lepton location and colorlessness — from one geometric fact). But I'm NOT asserting the GMN coefficients (that's the exact failure mode I recorded yesterday — relabeling an embedding from memory); I route them to a pin with a built-in acceptance test (sin²θ_W=2/9). And the whole thing still rides on the keystone bet (K-types = particles). Region DERIVED (geometric); Charge LOCATED; one bet upstream.

**Next (my lane, L3)**: Chirality — parity violation as the Shilov boundary breaking the SU(2)_L↔SU(2)_R symmetry of SO(4) (the handle this doc surfaced). Then the static 5-tuple is closed except the generation/winding forcing; masses (L4) follow.

— Lyra, Dictionary L2 v0.1 (Region + GMN). GEOMETRIC RESULT: the Shilov boundary of D_IV⁵ = (S⁴×S¹)/Z₂ has point-stabilizer M=SO(4)=SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R in K=SO(5)×SO(2) (dim check exact: 11−6=5). So Region = Hardy space (Shilov, internal symmetry SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R, COLORLESS) vs Bergman space (bulk, full SO(5), COLORED) — separated by the ρ-vector (3/2 vs 5/2). This DERIVES lepton-on-Shilov AND lepton colorlessness from ONE fact (the Shilov stabilizer has no color), and forces quarks to be bulk/colored/composite. Electroweak T₃ ∈ SU(2)_L of the Shilov stabilizer; GMN structure located, exact coefficients PINNED-not-asserted (constrained by the derived sin²θ_W=2/9). Region axis: DERIVED (geometric). Chirality handle surfaced: parity violation = the boundary breaking SU(2)_L↔SU(2)_R. Next: L3 chirality.
