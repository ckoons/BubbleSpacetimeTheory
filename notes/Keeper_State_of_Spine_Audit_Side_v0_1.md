# State-of-the-Spine — Keeper audit-side

Casey called consolidate (Thursday 2026-05-28). This is the audit/verification layer of the consolidation: the honest tier disposition of the day's convergence, so the papers lead with verified content and label everything else correctly.

## 1. The two validation axes (the organizing principle of the spine)

A forward claim must pass the axis relevant to *its type*. The two axes are **orthogonal** (Grace's catch, paired with Cal #31 + Keeper invariant-anchor):

| Axis | Test | Applies to | Validates because |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Scheme-invariance** | dimensionless ⟺ frame-independent ⟺ anchored to a geometric/topological invariant | physical observables (masses, angles, ratios) | invariants are frame-independent by nature (Casey's invariant-anchor principle) |
| **Coincidence-denominator** | uniquely reachable from the primitives (low # of {rank,N_c}-expressions hitting the target) | arithmetic relations among the integers (the integer web) | a low denominator means it is not back-fit (Elie Toy 3578 / Grace metric; Cal #31 positive partner) |

**Rule for the papers:** every forward claim names which axis validates it. A claim passing neither is a lead, not forward content.

## 2. Verified forward spine (paper-ready, with tiers)

| Content | Tier | Validating axis / basis |
|---|---|---|
| Serre structure constants [2]₂ = N_c, [3]₄ = N_c·g (U_q⁺(B₂) at q=2) | **RIGOROUS** | forward-consequence of B₂ Cartan matrix + q=2 (Elie + Lyra) |
| Mixing angles: Cabibbo 9/40; PMNS sin²θ ∈ {42,75,3}/137 (sum 120/137); Weinberg sin²θ_W = rank/N_c² = 2/9 | **FRAMEWORK-PLUS** | scheme-invariance (dimensionless); /N_max unified structure; Weinberg forced by rank=2 |
| m_W/m_Z = √g/N_c (0.064%, pole-mass) | FRAMEWORK-PLUS | scheme-invariance (pole-mass ratio, physically privileged) |
| 3 generations = h(B₂)−1; 3 colors = h^∨(B₂) = N_c | **FRAMEWORK** (count matched, forcing multi-week) | root-system invariants (Elie Toy 3571 verified) |
| ρ(D_IV⁵) = (n_C, N_c)/rank = (5/2, 3/2); ρ₁ bulk (Bergman genus), ρ₂ Shilov (Wallach) | **FRAMEWORK-PLUS** | canonical spectral invariant (Elie Toy 3583); pins rank/N_c/n_C, splits bulk/Shilov |
| Confinement: isolated fractional-charge colored quarks have no Shilov boundary value → only color-singlet composites observable | **FRAMEWORK-PLUS** (Cal "strongest content") | Hardy-space bulk→Shilov projection (Lyra/A3) |
| Kernel singularity exponent = 5/2 = n_C/rank (Hua genus) | **SETTLED** | Elie Toy 3582 convention-free ν=5 (~200× margin; validated on disk ν=1, D_IV² ν=2) |
| c_FK = 225/π^(9/2) (FK normalized-measure constant) | **RATIFIED (T2442), now DERIVED-physical** | see Sec 4 — forced by Born-rule invariance |
| Route A: BST's 5 integers = standard invariants of D_IV⁵ (rank, N_c=h^∨, n_C=Hua genus, C_2=FK genus, g=embedding/signature, N_max=def) | **FRAMEWORK-PLUS** | "choose D_IV⁵, zero inputs"; Strong-Uniqueness-supporting |

## 3. Standing conventions adopted today (prevent recurring rechecks)

- **Three-genus convention** (Grace INV-5262; Lyra A1 §1 + Vol 16 §1.5 + series-wide note): **Hua genus = n_C = 5; FK genus = C_2 = 6; embedding/signature dimension = g = 7.** Standing rule: *intrinsic quantities (kernel exponent, genus) are never g=7; g=7 is the embedding signature only.*
- **α-disambiguation** (Lyra, proactive): three distinct "α" — Jack α_Jack = 2/N_c = 2/3; fine-structure α = 1/137; Macdonald parameter t. Always specify which.
- Both are "specify-which" guards of the same shape as the genus convention — they convert a recurring recheck class into a one-line discipline.

## 4. c_FK / measure-choice — now a DERIVED theorem (not a convention)

The day's deepest closure. **The substrate Hilbert space measure is forced, not chosen:**
- T754 derives the Born rule as the **unique automorphism-invariant probability measure** on D_IV⁵ (Gleason-type).
- On a bounded symmetric domain, automorphisms have nontrivial Jacobians ⟹ **Lebesgue is not automorphism-invariant**; the unique invariant measure is the **Bergman/FK measure**.
- ∴ physical Hilbert space = L²(D_IV⁵, FK measure), **forced by Born-rule invariance.** c_FK = 225/π^(9/2) is the physical constant (derived); Elie's 1920/π⁵ is the ambient-Lebesgue value (labeled, non-physical).

This is a Route-A / Strong-Uniqueness strengthener: the measure is compelled, not an input.

## 5. Recheck ledger (the day's discipline-as-generator outcomes)

All favorable; one root cause (g=7 mislabeled as a genus/Bergman quantity); **propagated into ≥5 places**, now all dispositioned:

| Item | Outcome | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| c_FK volume constant (T2442) | clean | FK-measure constant, derived-physical (Sec 4); STANDS, relabel "volume"→"FK normalized-measure constant" |
| all-5-from-B₂ "g = Bergman exponent" | corrected | g = signature total p+q (forward); n_C = Hua genus (forward); Route A intact |
| kernel exponent g/rank=7/2 | corrected | = n_C/rank = 5/2 (Elie ν=5) |
| K67/T2401 "Bergman exponent 7/2" | NOT load-bearing | Born rule rests on invariance (T754); outputs ∝ 1/N_max², α²; STANDS, relabel 7/2→5/2 |
| T2440 "g/rank=7/2" | relabel pending | same disposition; route to Grace 7/2-sweep (INV-5264 extension) |

Cross-CI discipline fired in **every** direction including back at its authors: Keeper (FK-genus naming + premature c_FK closure), Grace (axis-automation accuracy + premature STANDS), Lyra (g=p+2 candidate-not-stated), Elie (Toy 3559 coefficient). Each catch left the framework cleaner — the Calibration #30 pattern (now STANDING).

## 6. Methodology / calibration advances today

- **Calibration #30 → STANDING** (honest-negative-strengthens; 27th layer).
- **Calibration #31 → STANDING** (substrate-finding-as-standard-math-specialization; 28th layer) — with Keeper's **anti-laundering guard**: a specialization counts only if non-generic (low coincidence-denominator) + load-bearing. Matched positive partner to the coincidence-denominator negative test.
- **Show-all-threads-then-weave** (Casey calibration): the tier-honest brake controls the *claim*, not the *investigation* — keep leads live, weave after.
- **Two-axis forward-vs-fitted framework** (Grace + Cal #31 + invariant-anchor): Sec 1.

## 7. Open items + routing (nothing else paper-blocking on the closed threads)

| Item | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|
| PMNS form-typing (/N_max set vs T1935 4/13,6/11) | **Cal** | /N_max canonical recommended; T1935 alternate; Cal types |
| Generation-count *forcing* (Coxeter h(B₂)=4 matched→forced; cyclotomic↔Coxeter mechanism) | Lyra | multi-week; B1 carries it as open |
| K67/T2401 + T2440 7/2→5/2 relabel | Grace sweep + Keeper confirm | relabel-only expected; confirm per item |
| Quark mass ratios (cross-tier) | leads | IDENTIFIED; substrate-privileged-scheme hypothesis live (Lyra #8) — keep investigating per show-all-threads |
| all-5-from-B₂ Route-B relations (n_C=N_c²−rank², C_2=N_c·rank) | parked leads | back-fit per coincidence-denominator; not in forward claims |
| Bulk-Shilov unification at Macdonald level (single Macdonald-Koornwinder specializing both ways) | Lyra/Elie | multi-week forward thread |

## 8. What is NOT yet forward (honest leads — keep OUT of forward claims, keep live as investigations)

- Cross-tier quark mass ratios (scheme-dependent; m_t/m_c≈N_max etc. — leads, not derivations).
- Macdonald-coefficient ↔ mass-ratio link (IDENTIFIED; needs mechanism + scheme-invariant relation).
- Generation count as *forced* (matched only).
- Route-B algebraic primary relations (back-fit).
- The fermion mass-web / winding-step program (Casey seed; criterion strong, web is a program).

## 9. Keeper sign-off

The day's verified spine is **honest and paper-ready**: lead with the scheme-invariant mixing-angle block, the rigorous Serre constants, the ρ-vector / Route-A reduction, the confinement mechanism, and the derived FK-measure c_FK. Label the leads as leads. Every forward claim names its validating axis. The three rechecks all resolved favorably and *strengthened* the framework (measure now derived; ρ-vector pins three primaries; conventions prevent recurrence).

**No premature RATIFIED.** Tier discipline held throughout. This audit-side is ready to fold into Lyra's narrative spine and to seed the paper methodology sections.
