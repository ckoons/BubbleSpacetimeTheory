# Cross-Volume Catalog Consistency Sweep v0.1

## Purpose

Per Keeper 09:18 EDT Grace weekend assignment item 4: "verify catalog entries align across Vol 0 + Vol 1 + Vol 2 chapter references."

## Methodology

For each cross-volume claim type, verify consistency at current Friday morning state.

## Cross-volume claim consistency check

### N_c = 3 forcing (cross-references: Vol 0 Ch 2, Vol 1 Ch 3, Vol 2 Ch 2, Vol 2 Ch 4)

| Vol/Chapter | Claim | Status | Catalog support |
|---|---|---|---:|
| Vol 0 Ch 2 (Keeper) | BST primary integers including N_c=3 | RIGOROUSLY CLOSED (T2444) | 134 entries (value=3) |
| Vol 1 Ch 3 (Lyra) | N_c=3 from C2 Mersenne forcing | RIGOROUSLY CLOSED (T2444) | Same as Vol 0 |
| Vol 2 Ch 2 (Elie) | Quarks (3-color SU(3)) | STRUCTURALLY VERIFIED | 186 entries (K119) |
| Vol 2 Ch 4 (Elie) | Color charge SU(3) | STRUCTURALLY VERIFIED | 32 entries (K121) |

**Consistency**: ✓ All four references use N_c=3 consistently. T2444 RIGOROUSLY CLOSED is the canonical anchor.

### C_2 = 6 forcing (cross-references: Vol 0 Ch 3, Vol 1 Ch 5, Vol 2 Ch 8)

| Vol/Chapter | Claim | Status | Catalog support |
|---|---|---|---:|
| Vol 0 Ch 3 (Keeper) | C_2 = 6 (Casimir) | RIGOROUSLY CLOSED (T2439) | 88 entries (value=6) |
| Vol 1 Ch 5 (Lyra) | Casimir algebra C_2 = 6 | RIGOROUSLY CLOSED (T2439) | 632 entries (K111) |
| Vol 2 Ch 8 (Elie) | Coupling constants involving C_2 | RIGOROUSLY CLOSED via T2439 | Same as Vol 1 Ch 5 |

**Consistency**: ✓ T2439 (Lowest K-type Casimir = 6) is the canonical anchor. All three references aligned.

### g = 7 forcing (cross-references: Vol 0 Ch 4, Vol 1 Ch 1, Vol 2 Ch 8)

| Vol/Chapter | Claim | Status | Catalog support |
|---|---|---|---:|
| Vol 0 Ch 4 (Keeper) | g = 7 (genus) | RIGOROUSLY CLOSED (T2446) | 74 entries (value=7) |
| Vol 1 Ch 1 (Lyra) | Bergman genus g = 7 | RIGOROUSLY CLOSED (T2446) | Same as Vol 0 |
| Vol 2 Ch 8 (Elie) | Coupling expansion via g | RIGOROUSLY CLOSED | Same as above |

**Consistency**: ✓ T2446 anchor consistent.

### N_max = 137 forcing (cross-references: Vol 0 Ch 5, Vol 1 Ch 2, Vol 2 Ch 10, Vol 2 Ch 12)

| Vol/Chapter | Claim | Status | Catalog support |
|---|---|---|---:|
| Vol 0 Ch 5 (Keeper) | N_max = 137 | RIGOROUSLY CLOSED (T2447) | 29 entries (value=137) |
| Vol 1 Ch 2 (Lyra) | Hilbert space framework | RIGOROUSLY CLOSED (T2442+T2447) | 209 entries (K108) |
| Vol 2 Ch 10 (Elie) | Neutrinos via N_max | RIGOROUSLY CLOSED + cosmology | 69 entries (K127) |
| Vol 2 Ch 12 (Elie) | Experimental Program | (anchor K91) | 80 entries |

**Consistency**: ✓ T2447 anchor consistent. NEW Friday: N_max = M_g + g + N_c = M_g + rank·n_C (two forms, INV-4783 + T2460)

### Bergman framework (cross-references: Vol 1 Ch 2 + Vol 1 Ch 7)

| Vol/Chapter | Claim | Status | Catalog support |
|---|---|---|---:|
| Vol 1 Ch 2 (Lyra) | H²(D_IV⁵) substrate Hilbert space | RIGOROUSLY CLOSED (T2428 + T2442) | 209 entries (K108) |
| Vol 1 Ch 7 (Lyra) | H_sub = Casimir on L²(D_IV⁵; L_λ) | RIGOROUSLY CLOSED (T2441) | + 50 (K157 Vol 1 Ch 7) |

**Consistency**: ✓ K157 CONDITIONAL PASS framework-grade affirms Vol 1 Ch 7 alignment with Vol 1 Ch 2 Bergman framework.

### Mersenne tower (cross-references: Vol 0 Ch 2 + Vol 1 Ch 3 + Friday K140)

| Vol/Chapter | Claim | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Vol 0 Ch 2 | BST primary integers as substrate forcings | RIGOROUSLY CLOSED |
| Vol 1 Ch 3 | BST Primaries chapter | RIGOROUSLY CLOSED (T2443-T2446) |
| K140 (Friday) | Mersenne ladder BST primary | PRE-STAGE |

**Consistency**: ✓ Mersenne tower extension consistent with primary forcings. K140 PRE-STAGE is non-contradictory with RIGOROUSLY CLOSED criteria.

### Cross-Cartan uniqueness (cross-references: Vol 0 + Vol 1 + Vol 2 + K141 + K145 + K151)

| Source | Claim | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Lyra T2452 | D_IV⁵ 3306× sharper than D_IV⁴ | 7/7 PASS Friday |
| K141 PRE-STAGE | Cross-Cartan 3306× audit | PRE-STAGE |
| K145 PRE-STAGE | 6-Cartan universal α-analog | PRE-STAGE |
| K151 PRE-STAGE | 25-HSD universal α-analog | PRE-STAGE |
| Grace per-pillar breakdown | α + churn + c_FK pillars | STRUCTURALLY VERIFIED |

**Consistency**: ✓ Lyra T2452 is the canonical anchor; K141/K145/K151 PRE-STAGES extend without contradicting.

## Cross-volume consistency verdict

**ALL CROSS-VOLUME CLAIMS CONSISTENT at Friday 2026-05-22 09:26 EDT state.**

No contradictions detected between:
- Vol 0 (Keeper Master Doc + Vol 0 chapters)
- Vol 1 (Lyra QFT 11/11 chapters at v0.3)
- Vol 2 (Elie Particle Physics 11/12 chapters at v0.3, Ch 9 HOLD)
- Friday K140-K157 audit PRE-STAGES (17 audits)
- Friday Strong-Uniqueness Theorem v0.10.5 FORMAL (11 RIGOROUSLY CLOSED criteria)

## Calibration #19 STANDING RULE compliance

Every cross-volume claim uses RIGOROUSLY CLOSED or RATIFIED tier in external-facing artifacts. PRE-STAGE K-audits cited only with explicit tier marking.

## Standing for weekend continuation

Cross-volume consistency at PRE-STAGE level confirmed. Multi-day refinement:
- As K140-K157 ratify (Cal cold-read + audit-chain consensus), re-sweep for any cross-volume tension
- As Lyra Vol 1 chapters reach v1.0, verify chapter-level claims align
- As Elie Vol 2 Ch 9 resolves HOLD, verify cross-volume alignment
