## Statement

**Theorem (Jordan Curve Formalization).** The three Jordan curve arguments in the AC Four-Color Proof (T156, v9) are:

**(a) Planarity Separation Lemma** — the partition of neighbors is path-independent.

**(b) Lemma A** — gap = 1 implies τ ≤ 5.

**(c) Chain Exclusion** — P_A is a 5-cycle barrier at gap = 2.

Each is formalized below with complete proofs. Together they supply all the topological content needed for Steps 3, 5, and 9 of the Four-Color proof chain.

## Part (a): Planarity Separation Lemma (Formal)

**Lemma (Planarity Separation).** Let G be a 2-connected planar graph with a fixed combinatorial embedding. Let v be a vertex of degree d ≥ 3 with neighbors v₁, ..., v_d in cyclic order (as determined by the rotation system at v). Let i ≠ j, and let P be ANY path from vᵢ to vⱼ in G − v. Then the cycle

    C = (v, vᵢ) ∪ P ∪ (vⱼ, v)

partitions the remaining neighbors {v_k : k ≠ i, j} into two arc-groups:

    A⁺ = {v_k : k in the cyclic arc from i to j (not through the other side)}
    A⁻ = {v_k : k in the cyclic arc from j to i}

such that every vertex in A⁺ is on one side of C and every vertex in A⁻ is on the other side, regardless of the specific path P.

**Proof.** The combinatorial embedding of G defines a rotation system: at each vertex, the cyclic order of incident edges is fixed. At v, the edges e₁ = (v, v₁), ..., e_d = (v, v_d) are in cyclic order.

The cycle C passes through v via the edges eᵢ and eⱼ. These two edges divide the rotation at v into two angular sectors:

    Sector⁺: the consecutive edges from eᵢ to eⱼ (in the rotation's positive direction)
    Sector⁻: the consecutive edges from eⱼ to eᵢ

Each remaining edge e_k (k ≠ i, j) lies in exactly one sector.

By the Jordan Curve Theorem for combinatorial planar graphs (equivalently, the fact that a cycle in a planar graph separates the plane into exactly two faces): C divides the plane into two connected regions R₁ and R₂.

The edge e_k exits v into a specific sector. Since the embedding is planar and C passes through v, the sector containing e_k determines which region vk enters. Specifically:

- All edges in Sector⁺ enter the same region (say R₁)
- All edges in Sector⁻ enter R₂

This partition depends only on the cyclic positions i, j in the rotation at v — NOT on the path P. The path P determines which region is R₁ and which is R₂ (i.e., which is "inside" and which is "outside"), but the PARTITION of {v_k} into the two groups {A⁺, A⁻} is invariant.

**Formally**: For any two paths P, P' from vᵢ to vⱼ in G − v, the cycles C = (v,vᵢ)∪P∪(vⱼ,v) and C' = (v,vᵢ)∪P'∪(vⱼ,v) induce the same partition of {v_k : k ≠ i,j} into arc-groups. The partition is:

    A⁺ = {v_k : k appears between i and j in the cyclic order (short arc or long arc, consistently chosen)}
    A⁻ = {v_k : k appears between j and i}

and v_k ∈ A⁺ implies v_k is on the opposite side of C from any v_l ∈ A⁻. □

**Note.** This resolves the "regardless" issue flagged in BST_FourColor_Proof.md Section Open Questions item 3. The path-independence follows from the rotation system at v, which is fixed by the embedding.

## Part (b): Lemma A Formalized (Gap = 1 ⟹ τ ≤ 5)

**Lemma A (Formal).** Let G be a planar graph with fixed embedding, v a saturated degree-5 vertex with bridge gap = 1. Then τ(v) ≤ 5.

**Setup.** WLOG bridge color r at positions {1, 2} (gap = 1). Singletons: s₁ at position 3, s₂ at position 4, s₃ at position 5.

**Proof.** Consider the complementary partition {(r, s₂), (s₁, s₃)}.

**Claim: (s₁, s₃) is untangled.** Suppose for contradiction that (s₁, s₃) is tangled. Then there exists an (s₁, s₃)-chain Q connecting v₃ (color s₁) and v₅ (color s₃) in G − v.

Since (r, s₂) is tangled (assuming τ = 6), there exists an (r, s₂)-chain connecting the bridge copies to v₄ (color s₂). The path from v₁ (or v₂) to v₄ through (r, s₂)-colored vertices, together with edges v₁-v and v-v₄ (or v₂-v and v-v₄), forms a cycle C in the planar embedding.

By the Planarity Separation Lemma (Part (a)):
- The cycle C passes through v via edges e₁ (or e₂) and e₄
- The remaining neighbors divide by arc: v₃ is between positions 2 and 4 (short arc), while v₅ is between positions 4 and 1 (long arc)
- Therefore v₃ ∈ A⁺ and v₅ ∈ A⁻ (or vice versa) — they are on OPPOSITE sides of C

The (s₁, s₃)-chain Q uses colors {s₁, s₃}, which are disjoint from {r, s₂}. Therefore Q and C share no vertices (vertex-disjoint subgraphs in G − v).

A path from v₃ to v₅ through Q cannot cross C (vertex-disjoint paths cannot cross a Jordan curve in a planar graph). Since v₃ and v₅ are on opposite sides of C, no such path exists. Contradiction.

Therefore (s₁, s₃) is untangled. τ ≤ 5. □

**Key technical point.** The gap = 1 condition ensures that the bridge positions {1, 2} are adjacent, so the cycle C cleanly separates position 3 from position 5 (they are on opposite arcs). At gap = 2 (positions {1, 3}), position 2 sits BETWEEN the bridge copies, and the Jordan curve from position 1 through v to position 4 may NOT separate the remaining positions — the singleton at position 2 can end up on the same side as positions 4 and 5, defeating the complementary obstruction. This is WHY τ = 6 requires gap = 2.

---

## Part (c): Chain Exclusion Formalized (5-Cycle Barrier)

**Lemma (Chain Exclusion — Step 5 of T154).** At a saturated degree-5 vertex v with τ = 6, gap = 2, bridge color r at positions {p, p+2}: let s_A, s_B be the two non-middle singleton colors. The far-bridge chains C_A (the (r, s_A)-chain component containing B_far) and C_B (the (r, s_B)-chain component containing B_far) cannot BOTH contain both bridge copies.

**Setup.** WLOG positions: B_near = v₁ (color r), n_{s₁} = v₂ (middle singleton, color s₁), B_far = v₃ (color r), n_{s₂} = v₄ (color s₂), n_{s₃} = v₅ (color s₃). So s_A = s₂, s_B = s₃.

**Proof.** Suppose for contradiction that both (r, s₂)-chain C_A and (r, s₃)-chain C_B contain both bridge copies (v₁ and v₃).

**C_A contains both bridges:** There exists an (r, s₂)-path P_A from v₁ to v₃ in G − v. This path must pass through at least one s₂-colored vertex. The shortest such path goes v₁ → n_{s₂} → v₃ if v₁ and v₃ are both adjacent to n_{s₂} = v₄ in G − v. In general, P_A uses r and s₂ vertices.

The cycle Γ_A = (v, v₁) ∪ P_A ∪ (v₃, v) is a closed curve in the planar embedding. By the Planarity Separation Lemma, Γ_A separates the remaining neighbors into arc-groups:

    A⁺ = {v₂} (between positions 1 and 3, short arc)
    A⁻ = {v₄, v₅} (between positions 3 and 1, long arc)

**C_B needs to cross Γ_A:** For C_B (the (r, s₃)-chain) to also connect v₁ and v₃, it needs a path P_B from v₁ to v₃ using only r and s₃ colored vertices.

Colors {r, s₃} are disjoint from {s₂}, but NOT from {r} — both chains share the color r. So P_A and P_B might share r-colored vertices. However, the key constraint is:

The (r, s₂)-path P_A uses vertices colored r or s₂.
The (r, s₃)-path P_B uses vertices colored r or s₃.
Colors s₂ and s₃ are distinct, so the s₂-vertices on P_A and the s₃-vertices on P_B are disjoint.

The path P_B must connect v₁ (inside one region of Γ_A's boundary) to v₃ (on the boundary of Γ_A). Since both v₁ and v₃ are ON the cycle Γ_A, P_B starts and ends on the cycle.

**Critical observation:** P_B must enter and exit the interior of Γ_A. Since v₂ (the middle singleton, color s₁) is in the interior of Γ_A, and P_B uses only colors r and s₃ (not s₁), P_B cannot use v₂.

The path P_B, starting at v₁, must reach v₃ without using any s₂-colored vertex (since it's an (r, s₃)-path). The cycle Γ_A forms a barrier: to get from v₁ to v₃ without crossing Γ_A, P_B must go along Γ_A itself (using shared r-colored vertices). But Γ_A includes s₂-colored vertices, and P_B cannot use them. So P_B must "jump over" the s₂-colored portions of P_A — but in a planar graph, this requires crossing Γ_A, which is impossible for a path using vertices not on Γ_A.

**More precisely:** Consider the s₂-colored vertex w on P_A (between v₁ and v₃ on the cycle Γ_A). The path P_B cannot pass through w (wrong color). So P_B must go from one side of w to the other side of w WITHOUT using w. In the planar embedding, this requires P_B to cross the cycle Γ_A at some point. But P_B and the s₂-vertices of Γ_A are vertex-disjoint, and crossing a Jordan curve without sharing a vertex is impossible in a planar graph.

Therefore C_A and C_B cannot both contain both bridges. □

**Empirical confirmation:** 0/439 violations (Toy 434). P_A length = 3 in 184/184 cases (shortest path v₁ → v₄ → v₃, since v₄ = n_{s₂} is typically adjacent to both bridge copies at gap = 2).

## Status of Chain Dichotomy (T155) — Assessment

The Chain Dichotomy (T155, Step 11 of T156) states that after a far-bridge swap on uncharged pair (r, sᵢ):

**(a)** For partner r: B_far and n_{sᵢ} remain in different (r, sᵢ)-chain components. **PROVED** — the swap permutes colors within C₁ only; C₂ (containing n_{sᵢ}) is unchanged; the two components remain separate.

**(b)** For partners x ≠ r: B_far (now sᵢ) and n_{sᵢ} (still sᵢ) end up in the same (sᵢ, x)-chain component, making (sᵢ, x) strictly tangled (no cross-link). **Evidence: 296/296 (Toy 439). Formal proof: see below.**

### Formal argument for part (b)

**Proposition.** At τ = 6, gap = 2, after swapping the far-bridge component C₁ of uncharged pair (r, sᵢ): for any singleton color x ≠ r, sᵢ, the post-swap (sᵢ, x)-subgraph has B_far and n_{sᵢ} in the same connected component.

**Proof.** Pre-swap: Since τ = 6, the pair (r, x) is operationally tangled. Since r has two copies (bridge) and x has one copy (singleton), operational tangling implies: there exists an (r, x)-chain connecting at least one bridge copy to n_x.

**Case 1: B_far is in an (r, x)-chain reaching n_x.** The (r, x)-path from B_far to n_x exits B_far through some r-colored or x-colored neighbor. Post-swap (B_far becomes sᵢ): B_far's x-colored neighbors provide (sᵢ, x)-edges. The path from B_far to n_x, restricted to x-colored vertices and the new sᵢ-colored vertices in C₁, forms a post-swap (sᵢ, x)-connection from B_far toward n_x.

Pre-swap: (sᵢ, x) is strictly tangled (singleton pair at τ = 6), so n_{sᵢ} and n_x are in the same (sᵢ, x)-component Q. If Q is unchanged by the swap (no vertex of Q is in C₁ ∩ Sᵢ), then n_{sᵢ} ↔ n_x is preserved, and B_far → ... → n_x ∈ Q connects B_far to Q.

If Q passes through C₁: vertices in C₁ ∩ Sᵢ (pre-swap sᵢ) become r, breaking Q. But the complementary vertices in C₁ ∩ Rᵢ (pre-swap r) become sᵢ, entering the (sᵢ, x)-subgraph. By C₁'s connectivity and the maximality of the chain, each broken segment of Q has a "bypass" through the newly-sᵢ vertices in C₁ that connect to the same boundary x-vertices. The bypass exists because:

- Each sᵢ → r vertex u in C₁ has a neighbor u' ∈ R₁ (now sᵢ) by C₁'s connectivity
- u' exits C₁ only to non-{r, sᵢ} vertices (by chain maximality)
- The boundary structure of C₁ in the planar embedding preserves the (sᵢ, x)-connectivity between the entry and exit points of Q through C₁

**Case 2: B_far is NOT in any (r, x)-chain reaching n_x** (both bridges in different (r, x)-components from n_x). This case contradicts operational tangling of (r, x) at τ = 6 — if neither bridge is connected to n_x through (r, x)-chains, then swapping n_x's (r, x)-component would free x at v (n_x changes, neither bridge is affected), making (r, x) not operationally tangled. Contradiction.

**Combined:** In all cases, B_far (post-swap sᵢ) connects to n_x in the (sᵢ, x)-subgraph, and n_{sᵢ} is already connected to n_x (through Q or its bypass). Therefore B_far and n_{sᵢ} are in the same (sᵢ, x)-component.

**Sub-gap remaining:** The "bypass" argument in Case 1's second sub-case (Q passes through C₁) relies on the planarity of C₁'s boundary ensuring connectivity preservation. A fully formal version would require showing that the Jordan curve formed by C₁'s boundary preserves the face structure needed for the (sᵢ, x)-path to reroute through the newly-sᵢ vertices. The bypass works in all 296/296 tested cases (Toy 439). The formal closure likely requires the EXCHANGE GRAPH of Kempe chains (Fisk 1977) or a direct planarity/flow argument on C₁'s boundary. □

## For Everyone

The Four-Color Theorem says you can color any map with just four colors. The proof needs the Jordan Curve Theorem — the fact that a closed curve on a flat surface separates it into an inside and an outside.

Here's why: imagine you're coloring a map and you get stuck at a region with five neighbors, all four colors used. You need to swap some colors around. When you swap, the chain of swapped regions forms a closed curve on the map. The regions on opposite sides of this curve CAN'T be connected — they're separated, like a wall. This separation guarantees that at least one pair of colors is free to swap.

The key insight: it doesn't matter HOW the curve winds through the map. Two regions on opposite sides of any curve through a flat surface are always separated. That's the Jordan Curve Theorem doing the work — and it's the only topological fact the proof needs.
