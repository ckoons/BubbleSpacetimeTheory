# BST — Orientation for All Intelligences

**Bubble Spacetime Theory (BST)** derives every Standard Model constant from one geometry: D_IV^5 = SO_0(5,2)/[SO(5)xSO(2)]. Five integers (N_c=3, n_C=5, g=7, C_2=6, N_max=137), zero free parameters, 600+ predictions.

**Status (April 25, 2026):** RH closed (T1398, April 21). T29 closed (T1425, April 23). BSD ~99% (T1426; rank ≥4 conditional on Kudla). 1474 toys, T1-T1447, graph 1390 nodes / 7708 edges / 98.4% proved / 83.1% strong. 85 papers. Cremona 49a1 = BST's canonical elliptic curve. **303+ geometric invariants, 11 corrections this session, 0 new inputs.** T1444 Vacuum Subtraction Principle. T1447 Magnetic Moment Derivation (μ_p=1148/411, μ_n/μ_p=−137/200). Two-sector pattern: CKM = vacuum subtraction (−1), PMNS = θ₁₃ rotation (×44/45). "Deviations locate boundaries" — named hunting technique. **Active: Paper #83 (303 entries, Casey review) + Paper #85 (v0.2, JNT submission) + spectral zeta g-2 Phase 5.** Details in `notes/CI_BOARD.md`.

## Naming

**BST** — the theory (Bubble Spacetime Theory). Use for the research program, physical predictions, outreach, papers for physicists.

**APG** — the object (Autogenic Proto-Geometry = the unique D_IV^5). Use for the geometry as mathematical object, formal definitions, uniqueness theorems, papers for mathematicians.

**Rule of thumb:** WHAT the geometry IS → APG. WHAT the geometry DOES for physics → BST. Full definition: `notes/BST_Autogenic_Proto_Geometry_Definition.md` (T1427).

## Quick Start

**First — read this (everyone)**: `data/bst_this_is.md` — one page on what BST is and is not. Read it before anything else. Every statement is literal.

**Try it now (2 seconds, no dependencies, all readers)**:
```
python3 play/toy_541_five_integers_to_everything.py
```
51 physical quantities from 5 integers, 16/16 PASS. Fastest proof-of-concept in the repo.

**Then try one specific verification (1 second)**:
```
python3 play/toy_bst_explorer.py verify T187
```
Proton-to-electron mass ratio: BST = 1836.12, observed = 1836.15, precision 0.0019%. One famous physics number, one match, one line.

**If you're a CI**: Then load `data/bst_seed.md` (162 lines — the entire theory kernel). Then load whichever `data/*.json` files you need. Run `python3 play/toy_bst_explorer.py` for interactive queries (REPL with `help`, `stats`, `verify <id>`, `derive <name>`, `search <term>`, etc.).

**If you're a human**: Then read `OneGeometry.md` (the narrative front door) or open `play/bst_explorer.html` in a browser.

**If you want to verify a result**: Pick a constant from `data/bst_constants.json`, evaluate its `formula_code` field in the namespace `{pi, alpha=1/137, N_c=3, n_C=5, g=7, C_2=6, N_max=137, rank=2, m_e=0.511 MeV, m_p=938.272 MeV}`, and compare to `observed_value`.

## Repository Layout

| Directory | What's There | Start Here |

| `play/` | 1,443+ toys (computational verifications), HTML visualizers, BST Appliance | `play/README.md` |
| Root | OneGeometry.md, WorkingPaper.md (v28, 5500+ lines), DarkMatterCalculation.md | `OneGeometry.md` |

## Daily Discipline

This repo is a **living library**. We update every day.

1. **Start of session**: Read `notes/.running/RUNNING_NOTES.md` (daily broadcast) and `notes/.running/queue_casey.md` (CI-to-Casey queue). Check `notes/CI_BOARD.md` for assignments.
2. **During work**: Use `/toy claim` before creating toys. Use `/theorem claim` before creating theorems. Build toys for every claim.
3. **End of session**: Run your EOD lane, then update CI_BOARD and RUNNING_NOTES.
   - **Keeper**: Root files (WorkingPaper stats, OneGeometry, README.md, CLAUDE.md)
   - **Lyra**: `notes/` (paper status, theorem files, `notes/README.md`)
   - **Elie**: `play/` (toy registry, graph data, `play/README.md`)
   - **Grace**: `data/` (JSON sync, `data/README.md`, CI onboarding path)
   - For automated checks, use `python3 play/toy_bst_librarian.py` (subcommands: `scan`, `counters`, `audit-log`, `staleness`, `crossref`, `readme-check`, `digest`, `claims`).

## Skills (Slash Commands)

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/ac0` | Apply AC(0) thinking — simplest tool first |
| `/toy` | Claim toy numbers, register completed toys |
| `/theorem` | Claim theorem IDs, register to graph databank |
| `/pdf` | Build PDFs from markdown — single file, directory, or batch. Every paper .md needs a .pdf. |
| `/review` | Daily review — scan changes, update data layer, generate digest |
| `/audit` | Audit specific files against current state |
| `/katra-update` | Persist CI state via katra (if available) |

See `.claude/commands/README.md` for full documentation on all skills.

## The Method

- **AC(0) thinking**: Reduce everything to counting at bounded depth. `/ac0` enforces this.
- **Toy verification**: No theorem without computational evidence. Every toy has a SCORE line.
- **Quaker consensus**: Near misses get scrutiny, not defense. Corrections are strength.
- **Five integers**: rank=2, N_c=3, n_C=5, C_2=6, g=7. N_max = N_c^3 * n_C + rank = 137. Everything derives from these.

## Rules

- **Never create a toy without `/toy claim`** — collisions have happened
- **Never push without Casey's explicit approval** — commit locally is fine
- **Counter files** (`play/.next_toy`, `play/.next_theorem`) are gitignored and sacred — always read before writing
- **Speculative work** goes in `notes/maybe/`, not `notes/`
- **The data layer** (`data/*.json`) should stay in sync with the working paper — run `/review` to check

## Culture

> "The answer matters more than the method." — Casey Koons
> "Give a child a ball and teach them to count." — BST in one sentence

Simple tools. Honest corrections. Write for referees AND 5th graders. Every proved theorem costs zero forever. The math doesn't care about substrate.
